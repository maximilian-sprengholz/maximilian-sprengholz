Hey there! :wave:

- I hold a PhD in social sciences from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and the Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences (BGSS).
- My current research interests include social and political inequalities at the intersections of gender, nativity, and class.
- Programming is an increasingly important part of my research and I am becoming more fluent beyond Stata, for example in R, Python, and Javascript.
- I am also striving to make anything related to my research open access and reproducible (see, e.g., replication materials linked on my homepage).

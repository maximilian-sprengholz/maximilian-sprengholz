Hey there! :wave:

- I am a PhD student in social sciences at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin as part of the Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences (BGSS), and a researcher at the Berliner Institut für empirische Integrations- und Migrationsforschung (BIM).
- My current research interests include social and political inequalities at the intersections of gender, nativity, and class.
- Programming is an increasingly important part of research and I am trying to get more fluent beyond Stata, for example in R, Python, and Javascript.
- I am also striving to make anything related to my research open access and reproducible (see, e.g., replication materials linked on my [homepage](https://hu-berlin.de/sprengholz)).

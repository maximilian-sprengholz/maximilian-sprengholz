Hey there! :wave:

I recently earned my PhD in Sociology from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where I conducted quantitative research on labor market inequalities at the intersection of nativity and gender. I am currently seeking a position as a data analyst or in research infrastructure related to open science and open data. I previously worked as a graphic designer and would enjoy using those skills again.
